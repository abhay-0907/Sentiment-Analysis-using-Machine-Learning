# Sentiment Analysis 📝🔍

A machine learning project to classify the sentiment of text data as **Positive, Negative, or Neutral**.  
The project demonstrates the use of **TF-IDF vectorization** and compares the performance of multiple classification models.

## ⚙️ Features

- Preprocessing of raw text (cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization)
- Text vectorization using **TF-IDF**
- Training and evaluation of multiple ML models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
- Accuracy comparison across models
- Identification of the best model for sentiment prediction

## 🗂️ Tech Stack

- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries/Frameworks:**
  - `NumPy`, `Pandas` – Data manipulation
  - `Scikit-learn` – Machine learning models
  - `NLTK` / `re` – Text preprocessing
  - `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn` – Visualization
